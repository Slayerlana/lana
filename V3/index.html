        <p>      
          Against the backdrop of ongoing global warming, this design aims to raise awareness among people
          about the importance of living a low-carbon lifestyle and encourages them to adopt environmentally-friendly practices. 
    
          The design takes the form of a simulation of the carbon cycle, where users can click on the screen to release red particles 
          representing the emission of carbon dioxide. As the number of clicks increases, the quantity of red particles also increases, 
          simulating the process of carbon emissions. When the carbon dioxide reaches a certain threshold, the particles begin 
          to move in circular trajectories, indicating that people are becoming aware of the need to reduce carbon emissions. 
    
          As people start reducing their carbon emissions, the particles gradually transition back to green.</p>
